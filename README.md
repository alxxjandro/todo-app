Listify!

This project is the basic implementation of a todo list, in which you can create separate List, in which every unique list can contain different To-Do tasks.
Currently the project is about 80% done, in the future I would like some form of authentication, localStorage API or database use. As well as some other things such
as an Important and Upcoming sections, sorting projects by date, priority and such.

This project was created as of the Oding Project JavaScript section by me.
Build with JS ES6 Modules, Webpack, and CSS.
